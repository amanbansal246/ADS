Dynamic Programming
--------------------
dynamic programmig is a optimization version of simple recursion.
complexity of simple recursion is exponential.Now our task is to solve it in logarithm or linear complexity like logn , nlogn, n;

we can performe dynamic programming in two ways.
1. Bottom - up approach  C->c++->DSA->ADS->Hackerrak->Events->good placement
2. Top - Down approach   Good placement -> events-> hacker rank-> ADS -> DSA -> c++ -> c

Where can we use dynamic programming
------------------------------------

1. if we can broken down a large problem in similar(optimal1) sub problem then we can apply DP.
2. Recursively define the value of the solution by expressing in terms of optimal solution for smaller sub problem.
3. Compute the value of the optimal solution in bottum up fashion.
 
For example 
UglyNumber program is time consuming .
